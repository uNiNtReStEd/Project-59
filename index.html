        <p class="para">My hobby is reading interesting and knowledgeable books in my free time. Whenever I go to home from my school I like to read books after completing my homework. I am 13 years old and am in the 8th standard. I know that reading is a good habit which can provide enjoyment. This hobby can be developed by anyone however I got this naturally. Reading books keeps one happy and busy. It is a good source of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration and instruction. It makes us disciplined and punctual and most importantly a successful person in  life.
